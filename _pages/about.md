I am an undergraduate at [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/), Karachi - where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and South Asian Music. I am currently a senior and I'm aiming to apply to graduate school at the end of this year. 

My academic interests are diverse and I believe that an interdisciplinary approach to both education and the real world is imperative if we are to solve the multitude of crises that we face today.
