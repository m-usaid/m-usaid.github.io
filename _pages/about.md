I am an undergraduate at [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/), Karachi - where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and South Asian Music. I am currently a senior and I'm aiming to apply to graduate school at the end of this year. 

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science; particularly algorithm design and analysis, and computational complexity. I am also interested in computational intelligence, machine learning and reinforcement learning and their applications in interdisciplinary areas. Outside of computer science, I enjoy studying ethnomusicology and interacting with the world of South Asian traditional music. 

I am currently working for World Wildlife Fund for Nature - Pakistan as a machine learning intern, implementing a deep learning model to classify species of birds through images to assist wildlife researchers. I am also currently working on implementing multistage optimization 

Aside from academics, I have been learning _sitar_ under the tutelage of Ustad Sajid Hussain in Karachi since the last two years at the [Center for South Asian Music](https://habib.edu.pk/music/) at Habib University.
